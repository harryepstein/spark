Let's be right down the middle. Right down the middle sounds so boring. That's not what the audience wants to see. Thinking I'm gonna do a Jenny McCarthy thing where I'm, like, super sexy, but I got a potty mouth. Ah, no, no. Dee, you are never going to be sexy. And do not do a potty mouth thing, okay? We don't want to come across as lowbrow animals. Now, have some veggie platter and have some fruit, okay? That is brain food. Mm-mmm, no way, not me. Haven't eaten in three days. I don't want to be puffy. J-Mac's face, it's never puffy. Yeah, because J-Mac's face is stapled to the back of her head. Now eat some food. You look emaciated and sick. - What is that? - Fart noise key chain. - Dennis, what is this enticing bowl of white? - This? Charlie, that that's cottage cheese. Cottage cheese?

I have realized it's-it's not totally accurate because I've seen a pig eat a man. In fact, I've seen many pigs eat many men. It was a bloodbath. Well, okay, well, we can't do that. I'm gonna move on though 'cause you're losing me. Yeah. Oh, Grant. - A lighthearted barb, if you will. - Sure, uh, sure. His talk of pigs and man flesh is confusing as it is frustrating.

Oh, well, I am the proprietor of, uh - one of the most charming pubs in all of South Philadelphia. - All right. - Paddy's Pub. - Paddy's Pub! - Paddy's Pub. - Paddy's Pub. Yeah. Yeah, but listen, I am so much more, Grant. - Um, I'm kind of a jack-of-all-trades, if you will. - Okay. So the question really isn't "What do I do?" It's "What don't I do?" Wow. Now, there's a lot of confidence right there. I like that. - I like that, Dennis. All right. - What a guy. Buddy, can you name an animal that we eat but doesn't eat us? Ah, easy. Uh, sea urchin. - Uh, what now? - Sea urchin. - Sea urchin. - Yeah. Okay. Show me sea urchin! Ooh, one strike. - Oh. - One strike for the Reynolds here.

It's a little bit of a double entendre type of thing. I was talking about chicken, but I said "cock." Yeah, don't say that word. Please, I'm-I'm Just, it's a family show. So we're just gonna go with "chicken," okay? Show me chicken! There you go. - Okay. Ronald Reynolds. - Yeah! - Hello, sir. - Hey! - How you doing today? - I'm great, Grant. I'm just really excited to be here with my new family. - Oh Your new family? - Yeah. - Oh, a little bit of background. - Yeah, yeah. Uh, actually, just for for clarification. Um, he raised them, but he didn't sire them. Now, he may have sired him we're not exactly sure - but they do live together in squalor. - Yeah, yeah. I brought my blood bucket in case you guys want to run his blood and see if it checks out. - It'd be good to know. - Yeah, if we want to do a quick DNA sequencing at the commercial break, that actually would clear things up for everybody. - If we could. - It would set the record straight. Either way, I was always the odd man out, you know? I mean, you know. And then Frank here adopted me. And now I'm a part of the Reynolds family! - Yeah. Yeah. - Okay, well We don't I'm-I'm just - I'm not even gonna try to figure that one out, so - Okay, here's the deal, guys. From now on - I'm not gonna ask you guys any more questions at all - Yes! Other than the ones that keep the game moving. - Great! Yeah! - All right? Great! Show me cow! Nope, that's me. I say that word. I say the "show me" part. You just give me the answer. - Okay, Ronald? - Right, I'm sorry. Show me co - Don't say "show me." Don't say it. - You just said that. - Just say the answer. - Show "Show me"  is the part I say? Here's the one thing There's only one thing in the whole world "Show me." So just give me the answer, and then I'll say sh You know what, go ahead and do it. Just go ahead and do it then. - Do what? - Mother of Show me cow! Cow! - Okay, well? - Good answer. So, sadly we gotta stay here. Okay. - Charlie. - Yeah? - Just need you to name an animal - Yeah! That we eat but doesn't eat us. "Doesn't eat us." That's easy. Dragon! - Charlie, do you eat dragon? - No! I don't eat dragon 'cause, uh, it's-it's not a meal for peasants it's a meal for kings, and I'm sort of a common man. But they don't eat us. They, uh It's, like, a misconception. They actually eat gold and treasure. - That's why they're always sitting on a big pile of it. -  Bad answer. - Bad answer. - Bad answer. - Bad answer. - That's a bad answer. Okay, show me dragon! - I told you! - Oh, my God! Well, astonishingly, uh, one person surveyed gave the answer "dragon," so What a world! All right. The Reynolds family has won round one! There you go, all right. - Sha-booyah! Sha-booyah! - All right. But we got a lot more show to go! It could be anybody's game. We'll be right back after this with Family Fight! That's commercial, guys! Back in three. Yeah! - We nailed it. - Yeah, that was, uh that was terrible. We're bombing out there. This-This is exactly what I was trying to avoid, guys. What are you talking about? We won that round. Yeah, but you were being lascivious and disgusting. Dee was making sex jokes that were going over like a lead balloon. - At least we got all of our answers right. - Yeah, that's utterly ridiculous. I mean, how is dragon an answer and sea urchin isn't? Everyone knows I don't know, but there's always a weirdo or two in those panels who's gonna give a stupid answer, and Charlie's always gonna get those, right? - So - Yeah, I'll get the steal. - Yeah. - Plus, people don't even really eat sea urchin, Dennis. Most people don't eat dragons. - Well, dragonflies. - People don't eat dragonflies. Don't make that noise. I don't like it. Just relax, would you, Dennis? If we make asses out of ourselves, they just won't air the episode. Okay, first of all, you don't know that. And secondly, don't tell me to relax. All right, don't you start making that noise. It's not funny when they do it. It's definitely not funny Oh! Ooh! Oh, goddamn it! And welcome back to Family Fight. We got the Reynolds family over here with 100 points. We got the Barretts over here with zero. Give me Bobby, give me Dennis! Here we go! Okay. Oh, hey, Bobby, all right. All right, somebody got a little a little lead in his shoes. No. No. No, my shoes are fine. I assure you. They're made of the finest Italian leather. The fit is perfect. Therefore, there would be no room for lead. All right. Top four answers on the board. We asked a hundred people on the street, "Name something people groom themselves with." Dennis! - Laser beams, Grant. - La-Laser beams. Yeah, laser beam. It's the only way to completely obliterate the follicle. Show me laser beam! - Ooh! - Oh, yeah, yeah. That noise, it's too loud. Can we Can we just turn it down a touch? We cannot, we cannot. Bobby, you got an answer? - I got an answer. - All right. - Hair brush! - Show me hair brush! Okay, we want to play! Hair brush, that's so obvious. God, that buzzer noise! Isn't that just irritating as hell? - We gotta think of a steal here. - I got one! What about bleaching cream for your facial hair? - What the hell? - No, no. - I-I got it Drakkar Noir. - Mmm, too specific. You know what it is? I think it's a bride. A bride could be a good answer. - Show me clippers! - What? You can't become a groom or get groomed without a bride. - Oh, no. - Right, right. That's not the kind of grooming they're talking about. - I don't know. Charlie could be right. - Yeah. I got dragon. No, he's not He's not right. Because nobody else is that stupid. Show me pumice stone! All right, here we go. Reynolds family for the steal! - No, no, we're not gonna say that. - The comb, a comb! I'm gonna go with toe knife. Wi-With what now? With a toe knife, 'cause I I use a-a a sharp blade to dig the scum out of my toenails. Once in a while, I cut myself but it "puses" up, and in three days, it's good as new. - Sure. - Toe knife! - Way more information than we needed, but, uh - Show me toe knife. The Barretts win the board! There you go! All right! Okay, let's see what see what that last answer was. Bride! - Charlie was right. - I knew it. Do you Do you groom a bride, Lisa?

Top six answers are on the board. - Name something that people are afraid of. - Oh! - Whoa! Oh! Oh, oopsie-daisy! Looks like I I broke it. - You think? - Oops. Can't believe Ain't never seen anything like that in my life. What, do you got hands made of anvils? You want me to answer that or answer the this one? - I don't want you to answer either of them, okay? - Yeah, sorry. Because I don't know who won because you broke the machine. - That makes sense. It makes sense, yeah. - Right? Okay? Okay. Everybody, we're gonna take a couple seconds. - We'll be right back after this. - Okay. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! Start thinking of a steal, because if we get this one, we win the game. - All right, all right. What's the question? - Things people are afraid of. - That's still the question? - Yes. How do you not know how the game works by now? Okay, I'm afraid of game show rules. - You guys, I know what it is. - Yeah? - It's failure. - That's too pathetic. Liberal yahoos taking my guns. That That is a political firestorm, Frank. No! Oh, oh! The Nightman. All right, guys, these are terrible answers, all right? Now, normally I would've said the crust on a crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e burning the top of your mouth but I'm thinking like a commoner now, and I really do think that the right answer is probably clowns. - That's a good answer. - I know. - I feel it could be Nightman. - No, I feel like it isn't the Nightman He could be right, dude. Show me dogs! God No. Okay, Reynolds, you get a chance to steal and win the whole game right here. - Okay. All right. - Name something that people are afraid of.

We're gonna come right back and play some Fast Money. - How the hell was "Nightman" an answer? - Right. Dude, I think I'm remembering what happened. I took this survey. I got interviewed at a mall and I thought it was, like, a government thing. - Okay, all right. - That makes a lot more sense. - That's actually the only thing that makes sense. - Right? Okay. So I should play Fast Money, because I'm gonna know all the answers. No, no, no, you're only gonna know your answers. And that's only gonna get us one point for every question. - We need to get all the top answers to win Fast Money. - Right, totally, totally. - And then we spin the wheel. - Okay, you're definitely not gonna play - 'cause you can't understand a thing that's happening. - I'll play.

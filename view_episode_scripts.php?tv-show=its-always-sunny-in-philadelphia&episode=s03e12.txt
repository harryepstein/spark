                			Oh, wow, dude. This thing is disgusting. There's so much rust. Maybe we should wipe it with a wet rag. I'm not gonna do that! Why not? Because it's a goddamn circuit breaker, Mac. We'll get electrocuted. No, I'm just gonna use this screwdriver, all right? It's got a rubber handle. That'll keep me grounded. No, I'm pretty sure you have to be standing on rubber. Well, the bottoms of my shoes are rubber. Oh, no! You know what it is? You can't be standing on the ground at all. Maybe you should jump up into midair and do it. Hmm? Yeah. If you jump into the air and grab a live wire you won't get electrocuted. But then if you land on the ground and you're still holding that wire you'll be blown to bits. I saw it in Tango and Cash. So I'm supposed to risk my life based on something that you saw in the movie Tango and Cash? Kurt Russell I think All right, I'm gonna jam this thing with a screwdriver. All right? The rubber handle will ground me. And I'll be safe. All right. All right. Give it a shot. Okay. It's all set to scrape Oh, my God! Holy shit! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wh-What the hell are you doing? It exploded. You're making it worse! Bro, you gotta pay somebody to fix this, man. No! I'm tired of spending my money every time something goes wrong in this place. Well, we can't fix it, Frank! It's too dangerous! It scared the shit out of me, man. Well, get Charlie to do it. He won't go near the thing. He's already been electrocuted, like, 500 times. Yeah, man. I think he's starting to catch on to that. Dennis, get me a harness 'cause I'll have to be swinging in the air to do this. Are you kidding me? I told you. Bro, did you get the flashlights?

Someone wasn't paying attention, right? Free speakers, dude! Free speakers for the bar! Free speakers! Mac, let's plug these bad boys in. Yeah! We don't have any electricity!

To fix the solvable light problem in our bar. Yes. Absolutely. I hear you. We're saying we're gonna do the drugs and then we're gonna try and fix all the lights. No. Charlie didn't understand that. That's asinine. You want to rewind? Yeah, we're gonna flip the drugs. Make a bunch of money. Use that money to fix the electricity. Mm-hmm. All right. Well, both ways work. I kinda like my way. Great plan. Your way's terrible. I'm in. Let's sell these drugs. You're not in. Whoop. Thank you. And you're not gonna sell them. We'll do it, Charlie. Because we found the drugs. And you're bossy. Very bossy. I'm not bossy. Scumbags! Frank, come on, man. Look, we're trying to get some money to fix the lights in our bar because you won't give it to us.

You know what? It's not obvious. Now you're being too vague. You're talking about dancing clams in the What's gonna make you dance? These are the kind of nose clams that you crush up into a line of white powder. And you snort them up through your nose. And they make you high. You use a dollar bill or a straw to do it. They come from Colombia. They're illegal. And they rhyme with "propane. " Perfect. You found a perfect medium ground there. So you want to sell me cocaine? Yes! Why didn't you just come out and say that? Instead of dancing around it. That is so tacky. We talked about it in the car. It's a thing you do. It's not tacky.

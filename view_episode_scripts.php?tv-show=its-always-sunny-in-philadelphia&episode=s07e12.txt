Oh, man, this reunion is going to be awesome, dude. I am going to fire into that school, and it is gonna propel me back into the mid-'90s when Dennis Reynolds was a golden god. Yeah. Oh, I'm so excited to show these douche bags my new back. No brace, fools! Baby got back!  Oh-oh, baby got back.  Dee, what are you doing? Baby, got back. You know that one. Sir Mix-a-Lot.  Baby got  Sir Mix-a-Lot was not talking about women whose backs have recovered from horrific spinal disorder. He was talking about gorgeous black women and their big beautiful black butts. FRANK: Black butts are good. Whatever. They're good, right? Guess what. Baby got back, and I can't wait to shove it into these fools' faces, so let's get going. Whatever. I don't give a shit. Let's just do what we always did before every school-sponsored event and let'ssmash 'em up? Let's smash 'em up! Oh Smash 'em up! Hey, right? I got these. What, what are you doing there, Charlie? Huh? Oh, I'm packing a couple extra pair of underwear in case I get an atomic wedgie. It's not gonna happen, dude. We're adults now. I'm not taking any risks here, all right? And if it does happen, I'm gonna get high, I'm gonna go to the bathroom, I'm gonna huff stuff. No, Charlie, you don't have to do things like that anymore. You don't need to huff shit or eat weird things to get people to like you. Nah, I think he does. You guys were pretty much nothing in high school. If he wasn't the class clown and you didn't sell drugs, you'd definitely be nothing; nobodies. Well, if shit happens, I'm going directly to Plan B. We're not gonna have to do Plan B, okay? You know, I'm gonna come right out and say that I'm not doing Plan B regardless of what happens with you guys. I'm only here for Plan B. Oh, shit. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Faculty or alumni? Neither one. Well, you can't go in. No, but we're friends. We're buddies. We hang out together. We do everything together. I don't care. Okay, look, I'm gonna go inside because, Frank, I can't have you ruining this for me. But what am I gonna do? I don't know! Hang out in the parking lot and drink beer till we're done. We smashed all the beers. Oh, no, actually, I have a few more. You guys want one? You can't bring those inside. Well, then guess what. All right. Smash 'em up! (all laugh) All right, turkey. See ya, Frank. See ya, jerk jerky. Oh, yeah, baby, this is great. This brings me back. I'm anxious, I'm excited, I can't wait to see the waitress. Charlie, give it a rest. I know, but we've been clicking lately. This is gonna be a good night for us. Like, remember how she was the coolest girl in school? What are you talking about? No. Well, she was definitely the prettiest girl in school. She was not. She was not, no. Maybe the most forgettable girl in school. Yeah, which, by the way, is the worst thing you could be in high school. Totally insignificant. Either way, good feelings are gonna get sparked up. I'm gonna see her, she's gonna see me. You guys, you guys, you guys. What? Brad Fisher. Brad Fisher. He is not gonna be happy to see me after that present I gave him. Uh, what present? Oh, the box of hornets. Ooh, that acne really came back, didn't it? Yeah, it sure did. The guy looks like shit. Mm-hmm. All right, I tell you what. Why don't you guys sneak past him, and Mac and I will pick up the name tags. Really? How does that sound? Yeah. Okay. We'll meet you inside. Okay. All right, go, go, go. All right, come on. Hey, hey, hey, it's Brad Fisher, all right! How you doing, buddy? BRAD: Not great. Oh, yeah, well, the acne definitely came back in full force. Yeah. That's a shame, but I have products that will clear that acne up, man. It's not acne, actually. No, no, it's hornet scars. Ooh! Ouch. Yikes. I don't think I have any products that'll, that'll take care of hornet scars. That's more of a Plastic surgery situation. Yeah, plastic surgery would do it, though. Yeah. But lasers Lasers would do it. They'd blast those monsters Yeah, yeah, yeah. You guys seen Charlie around? Charlie Kelly? Yeah. No. No, we don't, we don't associate with him anymore. All right, I'm gonna take off. Okay. Messy. Ooh-hoo-hoo. Let's stay out of that. Yeah, let's stay out of that. Let's just grab our name tags, huh? I don't see 'em over here. Oh, here we go. Okay, we got Charlie, we got Dee, I got myself right there. Yeah. And, uh, I'm not seeing yours. Yeah, I grabbed mine already. It's in my pocket. Oh, did you grab it? Yeah. Oh, okay, well, pop it on. Uh, I'm probably not gonna wear mine. I mean, who wears a name tag, right? That's not cool. I'm gonna wear mine. I'm seeing everybody else wearing their name tags, so just pop that on, buddy. Nobody calls me this anymore. And I feel like it's gonna confuse people. It's not, because everybody called you that in high school, so pop it on because it's definitely a rule and they're not gonna let you inside without it. It's been so long. It's probably not even my name legally anymore. You're gonna have to pop it on. (sighs) Okay. (heart pounding) Good. Well, okay, Ronald McDonald. Don't call me that. Well, it's your name. So, Ronald, I'm gonna take a little lap around, get people abuzz about my presence at the reunion. And I'll meet up with you guys later, okay? (chuckles) No one, no one calls me   Is he looking? Who? That guy? Yes, is he looking at my back rig now? Do you see the waitress anywhere? Come on. Shut up. He's not looking at your back, Dee. Are you sure? Why are you so obsessed with this guy? It's Adriano Calvaniste, Charlie. It's the guy who coined the name "Aluminum monster." Really? That's him?! Yes. That's cool. I want to meet him. You have met him, Charlie. He called you Dirtgrub and he made you eat spiders. Oh, that guy! Yeah. Oh, he was, like, so cool. He was, like, way above me. Yeah, him and his cronies all thought that they were way above you and everybody else, but I've got a plan to get revenge. I'm gonna sew myself into their inner circle. Cool. How you gonna do that? Well, I'm gonna lure 'em in with my good looks, and then as far as I remember, all you really got to do to get in with that crowd is be really cruel to people. Right. So I'm gonna gain their trust and when the moment's right, I'm gonna strike. Oh, cool, all right. I'm doing it for us, Charlie. Oh, okay. Thanks. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Is it, is it him? He's coming over. All right, do you see a spider I can eat? I can eat a spider. No, stop. Charlie, keep your mouth shut, keep your ADRIANO: Hey, um, excuse me, but aren't you the aluminum monster? Yes. I mean, no. People don't call me that anymore, but yeah. Nor should they. I mean, wow, you've, uh, you've really transformed. You look great. Really? Mm-hmm. Thanks. Hey, Dirtgrub. How are you? That's so cool. You're so cool, Adriano. Yeah. Hey, um, why don't you smell this? Well, it's probably poisonous, right? Probably, but, you know, smell it anyway. Should-should I smell it? Smell it. Come on. Whoa, whoa, whoa, Charlie! What are you doing, dude? Oh, he wanted me to smell a pen, and I was going to smell the pen, because it's Adriano You don't have to do that anymore. Hey, Ronald McDonald, right? No, no. For your information, nobody calls me that. Right, right. What did we call you? Ronnie the Rat. Ronnie the Rat, yeah, I remember, yeah, yeah. Why did we call him that anyway? 'Cause he was a nark and a tattletale, and he became the main drug dealer when he told on the other main drug dealer. Right, yeah, yeah, I remember. Well, looks like the rat got a little too much cheese, huh? Fat. That's not funny. I put on mass. We eat a lot of cheese. We eat a lot of cheese. To put on mass. Didn't you also give everybody ringworm? No, no. That was a rumor. I only gave ringworm to Charlie. I got it from my dog Poppins, and then Charlie and I were wrestling every day because we were trying out for the wrestling team, and then, you know, we just sort of passed it back and forth. We passed it back and forth Although then we did try out for the wrestling team, and then I do think a couple of the guys got it on the team, so yeah, you're right, you're right. Wow, yeah, yeah, no, that is really gross. I mean, that is Yeah, that's about as low as it gets. They probably still have it, 'cause they're so gay together. Totally. Hey, Dee, why don't you come back to our table-- you know, have a drink? Oh, yeah, okay. Yeah? That sounds cool. See you later, Dirtgrub and Ronnie the Rat. Hope you suck each other's rotten peckers until you get mouth cancer. Mouth cancer. Can I come to the table? No! For some reason, homophobia, it's just, it's awesome to these guys. I'm sewing myself in. I'm doing this for us, okay? What the hell is she talking about? She's going to strike when the moment's right. She's doing it for us, dude. Really? Yeah. Did you thank her? Of course I thanked her, absolutely. Oh, what's up, boys? Hey. All right, I got your name tags. Oh. Hey, did you get on Mac about his? Yeah, he's got It's not that It's not funny. That's so funny. Adriano came over, blasted him about it. Oh he did? Oh, good, oh good. So Adriano's probably going to tell everybody about it. That's going to get around the whole reunion. It'll get going round and round and round. Probably not. Probably getting old already. So listen, guys, this is where we part ways, all right? So do do not talk to me for the rest of the night, and know that I won't be talking to you, because you lower my stock. You guys get it. I'm going to go post up one of these tables around here, let my loyal subjects come and kiss my ring. Listen, don't laugh when people make fun of me. Yo, Stash. Stash. What's up, brother? Dennis.

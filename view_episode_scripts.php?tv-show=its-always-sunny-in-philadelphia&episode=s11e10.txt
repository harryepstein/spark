                			1 DENNIS: Okay, so there we were.  We're in the brig and the whole ship just,  you know, bumps; we get thrown against the the wall.  Yeah. You know, the-the lights are going off.  The sirens are blaring. Whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  How did we get in the brig in the first place?  What do you mean, Frank? You were there.  I'm very cloudy about the beginning.  I think I need a recap.  Recap? A recap would be good, you know?  Just to kind of brush up on everything that happened.  A recap Now, see, I forgot that.  honestly might be good because, you know,  we want him to be completely clear  before the final judgment.  All right, you know, Right, yeah.  the amount of energy we're using talking  about whether or not we should recap,  we may as well just recap, so fine, fine.  So there we were. We're on a Christian cruise.  Yeah, we're all thrown in the brig  for various sins that we committed.  Me, admittedly, for a little bit of lust.  Um, and in summation, we're all good people,  asking for forgiveness.  My thing, not a rape.  Move on; you're losing him.  Move on; you're losing him. I just want to be clear.  Okay, yeah, yeah. I just wanted to be clear.   (alarm blaring, thunder crashes)  What the hell is that?  What're those sirens for?  Oh, God. Oh, my God, see, I knew  I shouldn't have come on this cruise.  I knew it! I mean, it used to be I would never even leave Philly!  And then, you know, you guys drag me to this,  you drag me to that, and next thing I know,  I-I'm stuck in a box on a sinking ship!  Hold on, the boat's not sinking. How do you know that?  How do you know it's not?  (alarm stops)  Well Oh.  There you go. It stopped.  All right, uh, I guess that's good.  I mean, like like, if something went wrong,  they-they'd come down here, they'd get us, right?  You know what, guys, what difference does it make?  You know?  Life is just a series of events  with no meaning or plan, you know?  It's like, we live, we die,  we're gay, we're straight, we're tops, we're bottoms.  Wait, wait, wait. Calm down, everybody.  We're gonna be in the Bahamas in an hour.  Well, you sure? Like, I I don't think we're moving.  We're moving. I can hear the engine buzzing like crazy.  No, I think Charlie's right.  I-I don't think that we're moving, and-and besides,  the buzzing would be, like, an electrical system.  You know? The engine sounds more like  (imitating a motor boat)  Yeah, maybe on a speedboat. This is a big cruise ship.  It's got like a big, deep sound; it's like a  (imitating engine starting)  Yeah, if you're starting the engine, but, like,  we would be hearing a steady  Gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah  DENNIS: No, no, you guys are all wrong.  No, boats are mostly computerized these days,  so the engine barely makes any noise at all.  I mean, they-they make a fake noise  to-to make people feel better, but it's like (deep humming)  But it's fake, it's not it's not real, you know?  It's kind of like how I carry a little piece of onion  around with me to elicit tears, you know,  in case someone needs me to feel something  about what they said or are doing, you know what I mean?  Do you have an onion in your pocket right now? No.  No, I'm taking a vacation from myself.  W-Was it a vacation from hearing, okay?  'Cause if the engine was going, we would hear a gah, gah, gah,  gah, gah, gah, gah Are you deaf, Charlie?  I was like (imitating motor boat)  (all doing different engine imitations)  I mean, that's ridiculous! All right, okay, all right. All right, all right, all right!  Goddamn! Okay, look.  Let's just, let's all agree  that it doesn't sound like a speedboat,  or something that's off-roading, all right?  It does make a little bit of a buzz.  Yeah?  But most modern ships these days, their engines,  they don't make a lot of noise,  that they do make a little bit of noise.  Can we all just agree on this?  Yeah. Fine, I can live with that.  I can live with it. Fine.  Okay, all right. (groans)  How long have we been talking about this?  Four hours, six minutes.  (Frank whistles, groans)  Well, there's some pros and some cons, guys.  Pro: We've cut our conflict resolution time in half.  Four hours, that's good for us.  That's-that's huge, that's huge.  Con: Charlie's right, the ship is probably not moving  because we definitely would've been in the Bahamas by now.  What?  Yep. Oh.  Well, that's not good, right? I mean  No. It's not good.  I mean, f-four hours?  Well The-the boat not moving!  No one comes down to say anything like,  "Hey, guys, there's something wrong with the ship!"  No, they've forgotten about us!  And we're gonna die in here! Oh, my God, I'm freaking out.  We got to get out of here. Help! Help!  Calm down, Charlie.  Help us! Charlie!  You got to help! Hey! Hey!  Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi!  Mm, yep, yep, yep. Mm.  Whoa. Yeah?  Yep. Oi, oi, oi.  What-what was that, dude?  You sound like a soccer hooligan.  Uh, yeah, that's just something I've been doing  with Charlie lately when he gets a little wound up.  You know, it seems to work.  Say yup, yup, yup. FRANK: Oh, that's good.  The most important thing for us to do now  is to keep our wits together.  We got to occupy ourselves. Mm-hmm.  Why don't we play a few games?  No, no! I just wanted to get away from you guys,  just for a few days.  Now we're stuck in a box,  and you're gonna play some games now?  You know what? I'm out.  What?  What the hell do you mean you're out?  I'm out. Nobody talk to me. MAC: No, Dee.  That's not a very good idea.  You know when my dad was in solitary confinement,  I used to write to him every day to see how it was.  He never wrote back, but if he did, he would've said,  "Son, you've got to keep your mind active.  Also, I love you."  DENNIS: Uh, are you sure he wouldn't say,  "Remind me who you are again"?  Ho! (laughing)  That was great! That was Luther!  My-my-my dad knows who I am. Yeah-yeah.  Hey-hey do the voice again, but this time say,  "I love you, son." Nah.  Oh. But, no, that's  a good distraction, like, um, you know,  like any kind of impressions you got, like any kind of  You want to hear me do a couple of impressions?  That'd be fun. Yeah, okay, so let's see.  All right, so let me know which ones you want to hear.  I'm sorry, Dee, I thought you were sitting out.  Well, I was out, but then these guys wanted to hear  some impressions, and since I'm always wanting to be of service,  here I am, uh They don't want to hear your impressions.  They want to hear my impressions. No.  Your impressions are terrible.  Are you out of your mind? No.  My impressions are fantastic.  Give me somebody. Anybody.  Do Obama.  Obama? Well, I can't do that.  Why not? Yeah.  DENNIS: Why can't you do Obama?  'Cause he's a black man and I'm a white woman.  Can you give me a white woman?  You think I can't do a black woman?  (laughs): I mean  No.  I okay, give me, name one.  C.C.H. Pounder.  Who's that? C.C.H. Poun  Yeah. The actress from The Shield.  Love that show. Okay, yeah.  No, I can do that. Yeah.  Let's see.  (imitating C.C.H. Pounder): Goddamn it, Dutch!  What other errands do you have us running for the D.A.?  BOTH: Wow!  FRANK: Holy shit!  That was great!  That was spot on!  Thanks, man. "Spot on"?  You don't even know who she is, Frank.  I just assumed she's a no-nonsense  black broad from the precinct.  DENNIS: That's exactly who she is. That's exactly who she is.  (all clamoring)  Fine, fine, fine. I'll do Obama, okay?  Okay.  Okay, what do you got?  Hey, yo, what up, son?  What's up wit' Congress bein' all  up in my ass and shit, brother?  Oh! Oh!  Oh, my God, Dee. FRANK: That is bad!  What are you doing?  That was so racist.  Are you kidding me?! CHARLIE: Very racist!  Deandra, he is the President of the United States.  That's our president. DEE: Well, hold on a second.  Why was that racist, but what he did was fine?  Because that's not what Obama sounds like, Dee. That's why.  Uh okay, well, you know, I-I'm just warming up.  Let me, let me try again. Um  Hey, yo, where my senators at, dawg?  Oh! Oh!  Oi, oi, oi, oi! Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi!  Welcome to my first ever dinner party.  I'm gonna have lots of these types of functions  in the future, you know, with my new lifestyle.

Yes.  If you truly believe it, then it will make you full. That's true.  Okay. Can I have a broad with me with big tits?  No, because that's gonna force us  to imagine things that we don't want to imagine.  Ah, good point. So get rid of my dog?  Yeah, no dogs.  Go!

Ugh.  DENNIS: Okay.  And then, um, you're gonna want brown with the white, right?  So, like, maybe, like, um, some, like, brown rice.  No no butter or-or seasoning or  Really?  I want mashed potatoes.  No, no mashed potatoes; that's just empty carbs.  Why can't we just imagine whatever we want?  Because this is my dinner party.  Well, then take us there! Yeah!  All right! All right, okay.  Everybody's got something to drink.  Is it a milkshake?  No!  No, not milkshakes.  Gatorade.  And it's gonna be  my favorite flavor: blue.  "Blue" is not a flavor.  How am I gonna taste blue?  Well, just imagine what blue tastes like.  It does It just tastes like blue.  Let's just dig in. Yeah, can we eat?  CHARLIE: Yeah, can we eat?  All right. Yes.  All right.  Mine's kind of tough.  D-Did you overcook this?  No, I didn't cook it at all.  Y-You (spits)  Spit it out! It's raw! You're gonna get sick!  Spit it out, man, spit it out! No, no, don't spit it out!  What are you guys doing? You don't need to spit it out.  For the love of God.  Look, just imagine that it tastes good, okay?  Look at Dennis, see?  Oh, I'm not I'm not imagining your meal.  No, I'm imagining a lovely coq au vin.  Braised with lardons and mushrooms.  I want that! Yeah.  Well, then have it-- it's right in front of you.  As is your buxom date, Frank.  Ah, come here, baby.  Oh, hey!  She got her foot in my raw chicken!  Get your hooker's foot out of my chicken, man!

I'm trying to protect you, dude! And me.  Does he still write?  Well, no, pal, 'cause you never wrote him back.  (sighs)  But, hey, if it makes you feel any better,  I-I read all those letters,  and he never once said that he loved you.  He just mostly wanted you to send him,  like, pornographic magazines and put drugs in your butt hole.  (sighs)  I can't believe you're saying  I could've had a relationship with my dad.  But you ruined it.  (scoffs)  Normally, I would attack you, but  I-I don't have any fight left.  DENNIS: Wow.  Well, shit, man.

Hey, I'm sorry, can I stop  Can you just move that light a little bit?  It's really blasting me right in my face. Yeah, it's been  blasting us this whole time. It's kind of blasting all of us.  Can you move the light, please? DEE: Just a little bit?  Sorry about that. Oh, wow!  CHARLIE: So much better.  Should've said something earlier.  Well, harrowing stuff,  but I think I got everything I need.  Could you mark down in your report,  uh, that I'm not gay? Because I'm not. What?  What do you mean, you're not gay? Since when?  He's gay. Oh, well, because  God answered my prayers and saved us.  That means that there is, of course, a God,  and if there is a God, then in his infinite wisdom,  there's no way he would have made me queer.  DEE: Oh. MAC: So I'm-I'm straight.  All righty. Okay. Look, look  are we gonna get in trouble because of this accident?  Uh, nope, you're good to go.  I just needed your report for my insurance claim.  Insurance claim? Y-You're not a cop?  Cop? No, I'm an insurance adjustor.  I'm just collecting reports of people's experiences  for insurance purposes. Oh.  Whew. I'm so relieved.  So, so are we gonna get a payout?  Well, you might have,  had you not just admitted to breaking  several laws.  What? Right, well hang on though.  I mean, we got trapped in a room  by a drunk captain who sunk the ship.  We almost died, man. Yeah, man. Yeah.  No, no, it wasn't the captain's fault. He was sober.  Well, what happened? Whose fault was it?  Nobody's fault. The ship just hit a massive wave during the storm.  In the insurance biz, that is what we call  "an act of God."  Well, God is great.

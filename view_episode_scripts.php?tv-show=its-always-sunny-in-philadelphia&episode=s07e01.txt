                			Good morning, South Philadelphia Animal Shelter. Yes, hello, I would like to apply for an adoption, please. Hey, what are you guys talking about? We're adopting a dog-fighting pit bull. We're gonna keep it in the bar, all right? Well, why wasn't I consulted about this? Because last time we tried to get a junkyard dog, we wound up getting a junkyard cat, and that's exactly where you're gonna go with it. Yeah. Because I don't want some goddamn snarling hellhound running around inside of our bar! Are you crazy? Look, we're going to rehabilitate the dog, okay? We don't want it to attack other dogs. Now we would like for it to attack people. If it attacks a person, great! Yeah. And, if the dog-- or when the dog-- bites a customer, that person then can go home and have a great story for their friends. It's a win-win for everybody. That's true! You can go, like, "Dude, I got bit a pit bull in a bar." In Paddy's! It was awesome! Awesome! And if you're an intruder, you should get bit by a pit bull. I don't understand. See, the biggest Uh, how long do you think this process usually takes? Just a dial tone now. She just hung up on me, for some reason. Wait for me in the back back. Okay, babe. Hey, who's that? It's my new girlfriend-- Roxy. That woman seems like a prostitute. That's because she is. You're dating a prostitute? Not for long. I'm gonna make that whore my wife. What the hell? I don't know. Are they? Oh, no! You did not just do that. Oh-ho-ho. That-that broad is a live wire. I'm goin' outside, 'cause this place is shit hole! What are you cocks lookin' at? Frank that woman is unspeakably crass. You're gonna marry that, Frank? She's been my number-one girl for a long while now. But she's still plowing other dudes. In fact, Tiger Woods has been calling her lately. No. No, no, no. That can't be the truth. That's bullshit. There is no way that Tiger Woods is interested in that woman. Look, can't you find someone who loves you for who you are? That woman's only in it for the money! Mm-mm! Let me stop you real quick. Someone love Frank for who he is? Come on! No! He's got a ton of good qualities. Yes, he does! I mean, like what? Like what? Dude, the other day, we were hanging out under the bridge; we found box of denim, and I'm, like, "You know, these look like good jeans in here," and he's, like, "You want to split it with me, 50-50?" I mean, that's a nice thing to do. I wanted you to have half of that denim. He shared half the jeans. Charlie! Charlie! Stop wearing clothes you find washing up under bridges. Oh, they're boiled, yeah. Yeah! Yeah, we boil all our denim. - Oh, good, well, they're boiled, so - Hey! Hey, you know, there is some dirty crack whore in the alley, blowing the busboy from the restaurant down the street. This is exactly why we need that dog. Let's get that dog! Mac, you look bad. Really, really bad. What? Yeah, is that your shirt or my shirt? That's, like, way too small for you. You look fat as shit! Okay, okay, I'm getting very concerned with the integrity of our organization here. Mac, you have gained, I mean, 50 pounds of fat. Mass. Fat. Muscle. Let's be clear: fat. It's fat. Frank, you are talking about marrying hookers-- this is ridiculous! What's going on with our group? We're becoming the Gross Crew. The Gross Crew?! The Gross Crew. And I don't like that. I don't want that, all right? I don't want that. So, if we're gonna have this woman hanging around, then we gotta clean her up or something. I tell you what-- what if we took a Pretty Woman and threw it Roxy's way. Hey Pretty Woman? That was a bullshit movie. People don't change like that. People change, Frank. Look at me. I went from a tiny twink to the muscle-bound freak you see before you. You're not helping my argument. Okay, yeah, and if you're gonna chime in, please don't do it with a mouthful of burrito. This is a chimichanga. You are becoming a chimichanga! All right, all of you-- I'm gonna give you all 24 hours to do whatever you have to do, but, tomorrow night, I am proposing to that dirty whore. This is gonna be a little bit harder than we thought. This woman is a real piece of shit. Uh-huh. Where's Frank? Don't worry about Frank, Roxy. We're here to help you turn your life around. See, a lot of times, the second act of someone's life can be much better than the first. Mm-hmm. Well, yeah, we just want to make some changes in your life, Roxy. Perhaps get you some new clothes. Uh-huh. Uh, hopefully, teach you some manners. Shut up, baby dick. All right, well, I'm out of here. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, I Don't go, don't go. We haven't even started yet. Come on Frank was right. This woman cannot change. People don't just change. People change! She can change. I'm gonna change. What? You're gonna change?! What the hell are you talking about? Well, I'm gearing up to get into my second act, you know? And that's very exciting for me. And I'd like to help Roxy do the same thing, that's all. No no, no, Dee. Aw, really? What? No, you're already in your second act. Me? Yeah. We're all in our second acts-- don't you see that? And I, for one, I don't want things to change. I want them to stay the way they were, because my first act was awesome. See, your first act was-was shit, and that's why you're so desperate for things to be different. But they rarely ever do get different. If anything-- God, they get worse. I mean, look at Mac. I got salsa on my shirt. He got salsa on his shirt. Okay here's howhings need to go from here on out. You gotta deal with this woman, because I can't handle it all right? She made things personal, and I won't stand for that. Somebody needs to take care of Mac, and that's gonna be me, because his fatness is starting to affect our entire crew. Mm-hmm. So I'm gonna take him with me, because the man is carrying around trash bags filled with Mexican foods. What's that smell? Crack. That is crack rock. Mm-hmm. She's smoking crack! Oh, she's smoking crack. Okay, she's smoking crack. Uh, this is no longer a safe environment for me. Mac, let's go. Come on, I gotta get out of here. Whew! I got a really good thing going with Roxy. She's a sweet bitch. Yeah, but she's mean. She's definitely only into you for the money. Well, so, Barbara was only into me for the money. Yeah, but you deserve better than that, man. Look, I'm already on it, okay? I signed you up on a dating Web site. I got you a date, dude! Yeah? Check it out, though. I got a little twist on this date. This girl does think she's meeting a millionaire. Why'd you say that, Charlie? That defeats the purpose. Well, I'm gonna be the millionaire. Oh. Explain. All right, check it out. You're gonna play my limo driver, right? You're just like a regular working stiff to this girl. She doesn't think you're a millionaire, okay? Then we're out on the date and I'm, like, "Oh, I don't feel very well. I gotta go home. But let's not waste this date. Why don't you finish the date with my limo driver!" You know what I mean? Smart, Charlie. I mean, yeah, she's not gonna be able to resist an opportunity like that. A night with a limo driver? This is a good idea. - Right? - I'm gonna give it a whirl. - All right, man! - All right, Charlie! Oh, here, I think these are are done. - That first one's done? - Yeah, this batch is done. Just get 'em out. Get 'em out-- whoo, baby! - Whoa! I burned myself on a rivet. - Yeah Mac, these blood tests are going to show you the damage that you've been doing to your body, and my hope is that it will incentivize you to finally lose some of this disgusting weight you've put on. This is ridiculous, dude, okay? We're getting older. We're not going to look 20 forever. No, I am going to look 20 forever, Mac, because the older I get, the more vigilant I become. All right, I don't eat lunch anymore, for instance. Yeah, and on odd days, I don't eat breakfast. That sounds miserable. No, dude, it's not miserable. Well, yeah, it is a little bit miserable, but it has to be, man. No pain, no gain. I am also constantly in motion. Like, right now, dude, I am doing leg lifts that are imperceptible to the human eye. I call them hummingbirds. And although I seem relaxed, I'm actually incredibly tense at all times. Dude, we've been through this, okay? I'm cultivating mass. Stop staying that. You are not cultivating mass, and if you are, stop cultivating and start harvesting. Bro, check this out. Try to move me. Wow, I'm not going to try Try and move me, bro. Take a running start. Take a running start. Excuse me. Did you want me to read these test results or not? Yeah, I was just trying to trying to move him. He's like a brick wall. Yeah. You try to move me, Doc. No, no, no, you're Read the results, Doc. Well, I see, uh, severe dehydration here, multiple vitamin deficiencies, anemia, low blood pressure. Ooh. Mac, look, I don't want you to fret, okay? I'm going to get you on my exercise program. I'm going to get you fit as a fiddle. Uh, these are these are your results, Mr. Reynolds. What? No, those can't be my my results. I'm healthy as shit. Well, uh, not according to your tests. I'm healthier than you, bro. Well, I wouldn't exactly say you're healthy. You have type 2 adult-onset diabetes. Type 2 adult-onset diabetes? What does that mean for me? Well, that means you're going to have to inject yourself several times a day with insulin, or else you probably need to think about losing a little weight. Whoa. But I'm healthy besides the diabetes? Um, no. But I'm more healthier than he is, I think is the point that you're trying to make. Even with the diabetes. Dude, stop saying "diabetes!" You sound like an ass You okay, dude? I'm fine. I just, uh been doing a lot of hummingbirds today. I'm good. Have you eaten anything today? No. All right, let's get out of here, bro. I'm going to get you something to eat. All right. I'm going to lift you up. What the hell? I'm not as strong as I thought, Dennis. Okay, I've hurt my back. I'm shit-faced. Yeah, well, you downed that bottle of schnapps like it was a soda pop. Look, Roxy, I'm trying to give you a second chance here, but you're making it very difficult. Hey, this jacket is awesome. Ooh, and it's tighter than dick skin, man. Can you watch your language, please, Roxy? We're in a classy place with classy clothes for classy people, okay? Don't talk about dick skin. Hi. Can I help you with something? No, thank you. We're just trying some stuff on. Um, okay. Well, you are aware that jacket is $500. Are you implying we can't afford that? Can you? That's none of your business. Um, it's exactly my business. Excuse me. Screw your dick skin jacket, man. Oh, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, Roxy, Roxy! Oh, God, no, don't do that. How do you like me now, gay boy? Well, now, okay, okay. Don't call him gay, 'cause it'd be one thing if he wasn't, but he clearly is, so Is there a problem? Yeah, there's a problem, man. I'm trying to buy this coat, and this asshole here is giving me shit. You are aware of the price. Well, here. 'Cause I have money. Oh, shit! Jerry, can I talk with you in my office, please? You have got to be kidding me. Oh, oh, face, Jerry, face! Take a hike! Sorry about the gay stuff. That did cross the line. Jerry, please, my office. Roxy! Holy shit. That was amazing. You humiliated that salesman, and then you had the capital to back it up. I love you, Roxy. Ooh, I got to meet a client. No, no, no, Roxy, you don't have to do that anymore. You know what? We should go find Frank, 'cause he's got a surprise for you. No, it's Tiger Woods. It's Tiger Woods? Yeah. Okay, th-this whole thing is blowing my mind. Your life is way more glamorous than what I was picturing. Yeah, yeah. Now, help me dig these crack rocks out of my ass. That's what I was picturing. Yeah. That's more like what I was picturing. Charlie, I feel like a sack of shit in this thing. You look good. I feel like I'm a I'm a four year old going to my sister's wedding. You're the limo driver. You got to look the part, bud. You don't look like a millionaire. I am a casual millionaire from Texas. You look like a farmer. Frank, I got the whole thing worked out. Now, listen to me. We got out on the date. I come down with a slight cough. Okay? I ask to be taken home. You take over. You charm the hell out of her. I'm so nervous. You know how long it's been since I've been with a non-pro? Will you relax? Oh, hello. Tarnation! You look as pretty as a peach. Yes, you do! Hoss Bonaventure, CEO. Uh, this here is my limo driver, Frank. Hi.

You know, you two can go to dinner together. Help me somebody! Please, help me! Aw, shit, Charlie, what the hell went on back there?

Are you familiar? Yeah, see what you mean about these shirts, bro. Yeah. You'll grow into yours, buddy. Yeah, comfy as shit. They hide your fatness. You know, they're ugly as all hell, but I have a feeling I'm gonna like 'em a lot more when I'm high as shit on crack. What's up, basticks? Basticks? Is that how you're gonna talk from now on? Look, I'm not taking no shit no more, so get used to it. Also, I'm gonna become a foot girl. All right, gross. Whatever. Frank, you ready? Oh, yeah. I'm ready.

Dead hooker in my apartment? That doesn't look good for me. I'm covered in blood. I mean, not good to have a dead hooker, right? It would kind of mess up our second acts a little bit. And I'll tell you guys something. I smoked a little crack in the car on the way over. Oh, you bitch! Oh, does she still have any? Yeah, yeah. > We can't leave her here. No, no, we can't leave her here. Um, let's, uh Oh, God. Okay, well, I mean I don't want to sound insensitive, but we could just put her out in the hall. We call in an anonymous tip. So we're still calling 911 Someone finds her. just from a pay phone. This seems like the best thing to do considering the circumstances. Frank, what do you think? I think Roxy would have wanted it that way. Well, there you go. Frank would know. I mean, that's it! You would know, Frank. Can I say a few words? Make it nice. Let's make the whole thing nice. Really? I just want to get her out of here. Oh, nice. Roxy, God bless you. You were a good whore. You serviced me like no other whore ever did. Not only my crank, but my heart. And I'm gonna miss ya. Amen. So should we get the dead whore out of the apartment? Yeah, yeah, yeah,

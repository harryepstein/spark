Today she is here to talk with us about her upcoming blockbuster Mother Earth. Tell us more about it. Well, this time I play a very beautiful woman. Uh, a warrior princess who saves the world. It's already grossed over $900 million in presale tickets, but I don't care about that. You know, I'm more interested in exploring truth through character. Amazing. Yes. And I understand you've recently become engaged to young heartthrob crooner Josh Groban. When I found out that Mr. Covington was actually a chick, yeah, I had to have her. I mean, look at her. She's smart, she's sexy, she's hilarious. She pops. He likes his ladies to pop. That's true, Groban does like his ladies to pop. Isn't he cute? Sing her that song you wrote for me. Which one?

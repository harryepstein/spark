Uh, my name is Betty Canuso, and I don't know if you heard but a week ago, Eastern State Correctional Facility was forced to release due to overcrowding. Eastern State? That's where my dad is. Maybe they let my dad out. Did they let my dad out? How would I know that? Listen, I'm here because of a man named Wendell Albright, a registered sex offender. He's moved into this neighborhood. Yeah. I'm hoping by raising awareness we can force him out of the neighborhood and away from our children, you know, once and for all. It's going on and on. Is there something that you need from us? Because we're in the middle of something. Please post these flyers anywhere you can. Okay, okay, okay. Yes, yes, yes. All right. Okay. Thank you for your time. Out. Get out. Get out. Some people have no sense of my personal boundaries and property. Let's set the shit up again. Holy shit! What? This dude looks just like Dennis. I do not look like this guy. Are you serious, dude? What are you guys talking about? He's, like, 40 years old. Oh, my God. Look at his jaw. Look at his jawline. His jaw is exactly where I don't look like him. His jaw is fat and it's Go, like, this far back. I never go that far back. When I do, it doesn't do that. I give you six to eight months before you start looking exactly like that guy. That's crazy, man. There's no resemblance Hello. Dad. They did let you out. Oh, my God. Don't touch me. Right. That's how it goes. Hey, hey, come meet my friends. Guys, this is my dad. Well, Charlie you know. Hey, hey, man. Hey, by the way real sorry about that whole heroin incident in the butt, but here's the deal. I had my butt filled like a Christmas stocking, and I wanted to come I got a little nervous, everything came flushing out of me. Wendell "Shorteyes." They let you out too, huh? What? No, I'm not Wendell "Shorteyes. " Didn't I stab you once? No, you never stabbed Look, I'm not Wendell, okay? I'm not a sexual child molester. I'm Dennis Reynolds. I'm handsome and chiseled and Now you got me thinking. I gotta go look in a mirror. Dad, what are you gonna do now that you're out? I need a job. Well, tell you what. I just got an idea. Bouncer. Welcome aboard, buddy. Right. Good thinking. Can I talk to you for a second, you guys? Oh, yeah. Dude, Dee, that guy really likes your hair. Yeah, he does. This is a very bad plan. What? Which one? This man should not work here. Why are you attacking us? This guy looks like he wants to eat me. Has he ever eaten anybody that you know of? I don't think so. No. But it'd be pretty cool if he did. Yeah, that is really cool. Think about the dedication you got to put into eating a human body. If he's got that kind of commitment, imagine what Son, where's the telephone? Do you have plans, Dad? 'Cause I was thinking we could do some father-son stuff. Have a catch. Talk. No, I'm not gonna do that. But I'll tell you what. Here's a list of, uh, all the people I, uh, promised to visit after I got out of prison. Maybe you can drive me around, help me take care of a few of 'em, hmm? Take care of a few of 'em? Okay, that sounds cool. You got a car? No. Dennis does, but he won't give me the keys. That won't be a problem. I do not want Mac's dad working at our bar. I was looking in the mirror, and I gotta tell you, looks pretty good in here. Jawline looks good Are you listening to me? I don't want to get eaten. Eaten? He eats people? That's awesome. That's not awesome. Why do you guys think that eating people is awesome? It just is. Asshole! What? Did you see that? Yeah, I saw that. Listen, I need your help, okay? You're part owner of the bar, and you're probably the only person that Mac listens to and I need you talk to him Dee, you're blowing this completely out of proportion. Mac's dad probably hasn't seen a woman in a very long time. And as soon as he comes across one that's actually attractive he's gonna forget all about you, just like every other man does. Why do you do that? Pervert! Dickhead! Pervert? Dickhead? Why are people yelling at me in the streets, Dee? Could have something to do with that. What? That's gonna be a problem for me. Take the TV too. Frank! What the hell's going on in here, man? I'm leaving. It's been great, but I got to get something more out of my life. Well, why are you taking all my shit? Well, it was really hard to tell whose was whose, so I just decided to take everything. You don't ever use this. I use that all the time. It's like the only thing I use. All right, slow down, Frank. Slow down. What the hell's this all about? Charlie, I need a woman. I need a woman to cook for me and clean up after me and somebody who'll do everything I say. That's just a maid. You want a maid? Yeah. That's right. A maid. A maid I can bang. Well, what the hell, man? I mean What? I thought we had a pretty sweet thing going on here. Am I wrong? We had a good deal going on. We hung out. We Breakin' records, eatin' chicken scraps. I know you're gonna miss me. Don't hug me! Get Get out of my apartment. Dude, I don't need you. No, wait, wait. You know what, dude? Before you go, remember one thing. We had about the sweetest life that two men can have together, and you're walking out on that. Charlie, you're gonna have to deal with it. You know why? Because I need that bang maid. All right. But you're not gonna do very well out there without this guy. 'Cause I may not be much, Frank, but, uh, I think you'll find that I'm a pretty sweet deal once you're out there on your own, and I'll tell you what else. You're not gonna find a bang maid, 'cause there's no such thing. I already did. Your mom. Goodbye. Okay, let's go. It's been about 30 minutes, Dad. What were you doing up there? Hmm? Oh, just, uh, keeping up with my, uh, correspondence. Oh, that sounds nice. How'd it go? Well, there was a bit of a struggle, but, uh it turned out just fine. Oh, good. Good. So, um Hey, I was thinking we could hang out, you know. I was thinking we could go on a double date. Go onto Match. Com, find us a couple of hot ladies. What do you think? No. No. Okay. Ooh! We could go on a road trip. Hey, Dad, let's go to Cooperstown, New York. I have always wanted to go to the Baseball Hall of Fame with my dad. Do you want to do that with me, Dad? Start the car. Okay. I'll start the car. That's fine. Um, just school me again here. Is it the yellow one to the black one, or is there orange involved? Red. Red. Just red. There we go. Teamwork, right? A little father-son teamwork. Okay, here we go. Put on your seat belt. Or don't. Here we go. It looks great. Stop fiddling with it. I know it looks great. I just want to make sure the glue holds. Remember, this is a twofold operation. We want to prove that you're not Wendell Albright but prove that you are a good guy. Good guy? Check. That comes naturally for me. Great. Now step one. This guy's a little paunchy, right? You're not. You got a great body. But how are we supposed to see that with this billowy shirt you got on? Pop that thing off. Whoa. Wait a second, Dee. I can't just pop my shirt off in the middle of a park. You crazy? I feel like you're not using your head. What better way to differentiate you from this fatty than by showing off this amazing body? There is an amazing body under this shirt. I'm gonna pop the shirt off. I need to show it. This is what I'm thinking. You go over there and put on a fitness clinic for these kids. Show that you care about their physical body. I care about the kids. I would never hurt the kids, but I care about them. Absolutely. I'm gonna go do that right now. Take a lap. Work those monkey bars. Hey, fellas. Hi, there. I am working with a program that assimilates convicted child molesters right back into your neighborhood. Kids, how you doing today? It's a beautiful, sunny day, isn't it? Here, gather around for a second. I want to talk to you kids about physical fitness. Now we're not responsible for making sure these people are rehabilitated but this guy's done his time and he deserves a second chance, don't you think? That's him right over there talking to your kids. Yeah. Nice and high over that bar so you can work those muscles. 'Cause you want your muscles to pop, you understand? You see how these pecs, they're popping? Take a real close look at this body. This body is chiseled. This body is You guys have a great day. Some people In society aren't very muscular. You should notice the difference. Let me show you another hamstring stretch. This is a real good one. You're gonna make your legs into a "V." Just like that.

Now that you and my mother are opening a dialogue here I don't know if you've taken any time out of your dinner to notice her ample breasts. What? Charlie. The man's been in prison a long time. He probably needs a woman. What you may or may not have known Is my mother happens to be one hell of a whore of a man-stealing woman! Charlie, that's just rude. What are you doing, Charlie? It's okay, because my dad already has a woman, Frank. Uh, you have Mom. She hates me. That's not true. That's not true. Mom, you don't hate Dad, do you? Oh, yeah. Damn it.

This isn't about them Charlie or Mac or anyone else this is about you and me, bro.

I think he's killing those people. Charlie. Holy shit! He's killing He's probably eating them too, dude. And although I think eating people is very cool, not if we're involved. No, Charlie, he is not killing anybody, okay? We're accomplices. No, we are not. He told me these are people from his past, and he's got to take care of them. And once he takes care of them, he's gonna take care of me. Oh, my God! Wait, that doesn't sound good. No, that doesn't sound good at all for you, bro. I'm on the list, of course, and then Uhoh.

We looked into all that already. He wasn't killing those people. In fact, everybody on that list spoke very highly of him. Spoke highly of him? What? Yeah. Apparently, he was making amends with all the people he wronged. Then if he hasn't been killing anybody, why are you arresting him? Because he violated his parole. He's not supposed to leave the state and we caught him buying three airline tickets. To where? Cooperstown, New York. Said he was gonna take some guy named Mac and some guy named Charlie. Oh. You guys have a good one, huh? Yeah. Oh, my God. Dad. Dad! Dad, you did want to take me to the Hall of Fame. Well, I wanted it to be a surprise. It is a surprise. It's a huge surprise, Dad.

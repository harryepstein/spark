                			Oh, God! Run! Where are you guys?! What's happening?! Over here! Over here! Frank! Where are you? Frank! Charlie! Oh, my God! Over here. We're all here?! We're all here?! Guys! Stop! Stop where you are! You four got some explaining to do. I got 15 different wedding guests out there with various degrees of injury. I got a groom-- face is half gone! And I'm still missing a bride. I don't know what happened back there, but we are innocent. We're completely innocent. Yeah, well, you four bozos are the only people on the scene that weren't invited. So you can see how bad this looks. Now, who is Mr. Dennis Reynolds? Oh, that's me. Hmm, hello, Dennis. Those are some interesting marks on your neck. Let me guess. Ex-wife's getting remarried, you get a little jealous. Get your buddies together, you decide to break up that party. So you crash the wedding, get a little tipsy, things take a violent turn. No, no, no, look. That is the exact opposite of what I wanted to happen. I wanted to make sure that that wedding happened! Why is Maureen getting married in the middle of the woods? I don't know. Some people find the woods romantic, I guess. And why get married on Friday the 13th? It's a monster day. I don't know and I don't care. I just want to make sure the wedding happens. I'm tired of paying alimony. Well, we got your back, bro. Don't worry about that. I don't need you to have my back. Three people crashing a wedding-- it's gonna make a scene. Why couldn't you just let me do this alone? Just don't like getting bussed up there. I feel like we're gonna be trapped. I don't, I don't like any of this. Oh, no. No, no. I don't like this place already. This is a strange place, right? I'm seeing a lot of bats. Yeah, there's bats everywhere. You know why? 'Cause it's Friday the 13th. No, no, no, stop. Will you stop with that? It's not because it's Friday the 13th. We're in the woods. Stop being paranoid. Still, this is creepy. I mean, who gets married in a spot like this? Oh, Jesus Christ! You guys crashing my wedding? Wait. What?! You?! Wait, Liam, you're marrying Maureen? Big-time. Don't be jelly. What the hell is going on here? What's your angle? Oldest angle in the book, my friend. Love. I don't buy this, okay? I thought you were in love with Ryan. What's your brother think about all this? Ryan's dead to me. Do you hear me? He's dead! So, I take it he doesn't approve? That's a negative, Ronald McDonald. Now, I'd ask you guys to leave, but I'm just too damn happy. See you bitches on the dance floor. I don't like this, okay? This is a McPoyle-Ponderosa wedding. This is, this is bad. Look, look, if you're gonna be here, I need your support. You need to help me make sure this wedding goes off without a hitch. Hold on. What made you think this wasn't gonna happen? Mac had heard there were some people there who wanted to ruin the wedding. Who? Him. Ah! That is bullshit! I was there to support my buddy. That was a swervy road. Yeah. What are you guys doing here? Oh, my God, I knew it. You're here to break up this wedding. What are you talking about? I'm here to support my friend, Bill Ponderosa. I'm his AA sponsor! Bullshit! You two love the fact that I have to pay alimony the rest of my life. You love the power you have over me with this financial burden. You know what, Dennis, not everything is about you, okay? I am here to support Frank. No, you two are here to make a scene. Oh! If anybody's making a scene, it's you! Ow! Ow! I just got tagged by a bat! He got you. I got tagged! Suck out the poison, Dee! I'm not sucking on your head. Suck it out! I'll give you $200, you suck it out. $200? I'll do it! Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'll do it for $200. Suck it quick. What are you? This is the kind of thing that I was talking about! Suck it harder! Go home, please! Suck it harder! I got it. Did you swallow it?! Of course I swallowed. Make yourself throw up! Yeah, you swallowed the poison! Get it out! Get it out! Vomit! Vomit! What are you doing?! There is no poison from a bat! No! You are gonna ruin this! You're all gonna ruin this! You all right? It won't come, Frank. Deandra. Yeah? Let's go break up this wedding. Whoa, stop, stop! So you were there to break up the wedding. Shit. Did I just say that part? Yeah. Why did you want to break up the wedding? For all the things he just said. That was accurate. But it wasn't just our idea to break up the wedding. Not at first. Last week, we had a visitor at the bar. They have to be stopped. The McPoyle bloodline's been pure and clean for a thousand years. This marriage is an abomination. Now, when you say "pure and clean ," uh, you mean what, exactly? Means we haven't bred outside the bloodline. For a thousand years? Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. Dennis knows Maureen better than anyone. Only he can talk her out of this. The last thing Dennis wants to do is break up this wedding. But we do. Okay, I brought a disguise. Meh! They're gonna know who you are. This will work. Now sneak me in so we can go kill Maureen. Kill? Who said anything about killing anybody? No one's killing anyone. We'll sneak you in to Liam so you guys can talk or bang or whatever it is you want to do. Frank! Frank! Oh, thank God you're here, man. I am not gonna make it. I am itching to get blitzed. Weddings are a big trigger for me, man. Why are you telling me this? You're my sponsor, Frank. Come on. My support system. Oh, right, right, right. Of course. So, do whatever you feel is best. Well, I feel it would be best if I pounded a beer. I'll support that decision. I wish I could. I mean, it's a dry wedding, for God's sakes. They're serving milk. I feel like maybe I should do some drugs then, you know? That bad? You earned it. Yeah. You do whatever you feel like. You're a good person. Frank. Mm. Cool, cool. Thank you. Thank you. Diddly Dee. Miss me? Don't answer that. All right. Catch you guys later. You're a bad sponsor. Why? I supported every decision he wanted to make. Stop wasting time! Ow! God! Let's go find Liam. Shit! Don't hit me. Things have already taken a bit of a dark turn, it would seem. Yeah. Okay, I need to get to Maureen before Frank and Dee. All right? Oh, we'll come with you. No, just hang back. I got this, okay? Dude, are you thinking what I'm thinking? Yeah. We could definitely get laid here. Huh? What? Maureen, I need to speak with you. Dennis! OMG, what are you doing here? Well, uh, I have reason to believe that someone is here to destroy this special day for you, so I'm sure to make sure that doesn't happen. That is so sweet, Dennis. I also brought along some legal documents, so if we could just wrap this up lickety-split. Legal documents? What? Yeah, I realize my timing is a little unorthodox, but, uh, I figure what better way to make sure your union is totally complete than by having you sign these documents that I need you to sign? So if I can just get your signature right here, and I'll run up and get Liam's signature, and this'll be on the books and your wedding Muh! My Maureen, you've you've enhanced yourself. Yeah, I got my tooth fixed. I'm talking about your tits! You big, giant new titties, Maureen! Why would you do that now? Why not when we were together when I could've? I told you I was willing to change. Yeah, but I didn't know you meant physically, that you would change physically. Why weren't you more clear with me, Maureen? All right, you know what? I'm not gonna get distracted. Just, just sign right here Wait! What are you doing in here?! You can't see the bride before the ceremony! No, no! Get out! I just need her to sign this! No! Get out of here! Wait, wait, wait! Maureen! No matter what happens, you got to go through with this! Out! Liam is your destiny, Maureen! Oh, here he comes. I didn't get it. I mean, I'm so close, I'm so close. Do you know where Liam is? Maybe I can get his signature first. I didn't see him anywhere. I'm sorry, but I got to bring this up. Things are getting really weird. I mean, check out Pappy McPoyle. What is that all about? I'll tell you what that's all about. Zombies. Zombies? I seen it once before in a rat, and I seen it now in men. Once one gets a taste for its own kind, it can spread through the pack like a wildfire. Mindlessly chomping and biting at their own hinds. Nothing but the taste of flesh on their minds. You know the thing about a rat? It's got life in its eyes. Black eyes like a doll's eye. Don't seem to be living at all when it come at ya. Till it bites ya. And then the eyes roll over white. You don't hear nothing but the screaming and the hollering. What are you doing?! Are you doing the speech from Jaws? - Nah - Are you doing Jaws? We don't have time for this shit. This is serious. Look, it wasn't zombies, okay? Really? Yeah. Then you explain what happened next. Okay, it's time to get out of here. I mean, look at that guy. The McPoyles sprung from my loins, fully formed! One of them babies tried to eat me! I ate him first! I ate him first! Okay, I'm with Charlie. I'm leaving. Wait. You guys are just gonna leave? You're gonna, you're gonna go? Yeah, we're out. You know what? I don't give a shit. Yeah, go, go, go. Yeah, get the hell out of here! I didn't want you here in the first place! Yeah, I understand the McPoyle bloodline's very strong. Legions of us thousand sturdy ones ruled this fine land. Our bloodline was as pure as the driven snow. Mm-hmm. And then what happened? Syphilis killed about half of us. Mm. Mongoloidism got most of the rest. Right. Yep. Well, there's somebody inside who wants to talk to you about this. Mm? Who's this guy? Ryan! We need to talk! We'll leave you guys alone. Let them hash it out themselves. It'll bust up. What the hell is that? Holy shit. I'm gonna go. No, no, no, Deandra! What? - No, you gotta stay! - I don't have to stay. You gotta finish this. Uh, I'm not going to. But we're not done! Don't, don't go out there! Deandra! And we never saw Dee again. Oh, no. No. We saw Dee. Yeah. Yeah, that's when the shit started hitting the fan. Oh, look, there's Dee! Dee! Dee! Don't go down there! Do not go down there! We just got attacked by a bunch of zombies! Yeah, and the shuttle bus is gone! A zombie must have stolen your car! Your car is gone! There's no way out of here! There's no way out! What are you doing? She's infected! She's infected! Liam? Liam?! Liam! Hello, Liam? Frank? Hi, Dennis. What did you do with Liam? You're too late. He's getting talked out of it! Ha-ha-ha! Get out of my way. No! Get out of my way, Frank! Hey, man. What are you guys doing? I'm begging Liam for forgiveness! It's time we move on. Liam convinced me it's not our blood that's being tainted. It's us tainting the blood of others. McPoyles will take over the world! Goddamn it! It backfired! Wonderful. And first step towards that is signing this. So Liam, if you'd just sign right there, please. Just sign right there. Go ahead. You got it. Stupid asses. One down, one to go. Nice try, Frank. What the hell is going on? Get the hell out of the way. Get out of the way! Jesus Christ! We gotta get out of here. I'm not going anywhere, Frank. I'm not going anywhere till I get that signature. Go, go, go! Hey, dude, check it out. Remember when Dee, you know, she sucked that bat poison or whatever out of Frank's head from the vampire bat? Yeah. That must be what turned her into a zombie. Why would a vampire bat turn you into a zombie? You're mixing up your horror genres. If anything, it would turn you into a vampire. Right or a bat, or a bat. Or Batman. No, a vampire turns you into a vampire. A zombie turns you into a zombie and Batman didn't get turned into anything. He just likes bats. That can't possibly be what Batman's about. It's about a grown man who dresses up like a bat? And goes around solving crimes and mysteries, yes. These are Academy Award winning movies. This is serious stuff. Well, you know the Academy, Charlie, I mean I know the Academy as well as anybody. Sometimes, it's atrocious. Well, to bring it all back around, I think when Dee drank the bat blood, that's how she got sick. Frank's blood. Yes, but the bat juices. You know, the bat saliva, bat rabies. No, no, it's not Bat rabies, I buy. Bat rabies. Yeah. Like the Dude, we got to get out of here. Yeah, go. Things had gotten completely insane. Dennis was trying to get the signature from Maureen, but we were just trying to get the hell out of there. Oh, my God. What the hell? Frank, what the hell's going on? Dude, we got to get out of here. Where's Dennis? I lost him. You guys, I couldn't get it. I couldn't get it. She wouldn't sign it. I couldn't get the stupid bitch to sign. She didn't sign? This has all gone bad. It's gone terribly, terribly bad. What did you do? I did something bad. I did something really, really bad; guys, we got to get out of here before everybody finds out what happened. Guys, I messed up. I messed up bad. All right, guys, let's just make a break for it. Which way? One, two, three, go. Come on, come on, this way, this way, this way. My face! My face! My face! One, two, three. Oh, God! Frank! Over here, over here. And then that's where you picked us up, and honestly, that's all that we know. Yes. So you're telling me that this was a wedding full of zombies? Yeah. Well, bat rabies zombies. Whatever. There was weird incestuous jealousies, we don't know what was going on. Bottom line, you got the wrong guys. We're innocent. Yes, we're totally innocent. Marconi, we just picked somebody up from the site who's claiming to know what happened. She was locked in a freezer. Don't let her in here. No, she's been infected. I'm not infected, you stupid idiots. No one was infected. Here's what happened. Let them hash it out themselves. It'll bust up. Yeah. I'm gonna go. Deandra. Dee's nuts. What's the haps? Here, have a sip, right from the cow's titty. You'll love it. No, Bill, no. I got to get out of here, okay? Shit is going crazy. No, don't go. Party's just starting. You got to have some. Come on, try it. Come on, it'll loosen you up a bit, make your butthole hot. How is drinking a glass of milk going to loosen me up, Bill? Well, I spiked the milk with methylenedioxypyrovalerone. What? It's bath salts. Yeah, yeah, it's like coke and acid and meth all combined. It's awesome. Yeah, I get it. So everyone here is on bath salts? Yeah, pretty much. Oh, my God, just move. Bath salts? The drug that makes people eat each other's faces? Wait, that would explain the zombie behavior. Right, okay, Dee, so you were on bath salts and that's why you went all nuts on us. Now it makes sense. That is not why I went nuts on you guys. Huh? I went nuts on you because of what you assholes did to my goddamn car! Dude, when was the last time you drove a car? Don't worry about it, man. I can drive; I remember how. What? No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, wait. No! What happened, dude? What happened? I forgot how to drive. I forgot how to drive. Oh, God. Oh, look, Charlie, there's Dee. Dee, don't go down that way. We just got attacked by a bunch of zombie people. The shuttle's gone. Zombies must have stolen your car. There's no way out of here. Dude You sons of bitches! You're gonna pay! You're all gonna pay! I'll kill you! You assholes, you'll pay! No, we won't pay. We never do. Okay, well, there it is. You know, there's the whole story. Ponderosa spiked the punch. Somebody hopped up on bath salts but Liam's face, and, uh, case closed, you know? Hey, good for you. Good for us. Bye. Ba-da-bing. Hey, whoa. Sit down, slick. Now that may explain some of the shit that went on here, but it doesn't answer the question of the missing bride. Since you're the one with motive and the last one to be seen with her, you're my new #1 suspect. No, no. That's I didn't murder her. Then tell me what happened to her! I-I don't know. I don't know. Listen, if you confess, I can help you, but you got to tell me what happened. Okay, all right, all right, all right. Okay. Look, if I tell you what I did, will you just help me, please? Because I need help. I'll see what I can do with the DA, but I need you to confess. Okay, fine. Fine. I-I was just going to see her to get the final signature so I could put this whole thing behind me. When I saw her Something bad happened. Something very bad. Oh, shit. Oh, God, Maureen. That was terrible. Who did those tits? The nipple placement is crazy. - I love you, Dennis Reynolds. - No, you don't. I love you. No, look, you're just gonna sign these papers and we're gonna be done with this, okay? Never. Let's run away together. Oh, I'm gonna run away, but not with you. I'm gonna find you. Oh, no, no, you're not gonna find me, no, no. We can't do this, Maureen. Oh, no, please. What have I done? Oh, God, what have I done? Oh, God. Oh, God! So all that shit about us ruining the wedding And the zombies and the bath salts and the blood It turns out you blew it yourself. Yeah, congratulations, Frank. You win. I'm gonna be paying alimony to that crazy bitch for the rest of my life. You expect me to believe this woman's gonna throw her entire life away just to sleep with her ex-husband on her wedding night? Huh? Really? Mr. Reynolds, you're free to go. What? Why am I free? No. Yes. No. Someone posted your bail. Come on, silly head. Let's go home and put this whole adventure behind us. No. No! No! No, you got to help me. What have I done? You got to help me! What have I done? No! No! No!

Cleaning my hands off. What are you, a cat? Use a towel. My mouth's right here. We talked about this. No getting high on the supply. I'm not getting high. I'm just cleaning my hands. We have to be very careful, considering our past addictions to glue and crack. We got over that. I got over that. I don't smoke crack anymore. You huff glue every single day. No, I don't. No? Did you have any today? It's still gross, Frank. We made a thousand dollars. No. I made a thousand dollars. You didn't do shit. You just sat in the car and read a magazine. What the hell do I need you for? Give me that money. Every ho needs his pimp. We got any vials around here? Vials for what? We went back to Bingo. We got a little of the cocaine back with the money that we got from the pills. You better go back and get a gun, because dealin' drugs is dangerous. No, it isn't. It's a rich person's drug. There's no danger involved. It's, like, stockbrokers and high-powered business executives. We'll just go down to Center City and Waltz into a board meeting, slap your drugs down on the conference table and be, like, "Hey, you guys wanna buy drugs? We're drug dealers. " Are you saying that's not gonna work? What are you saying? What are you saying exactly? I'm saying that that is not gonna You don't like that idea? At least we didn't become prostitutes. I am not a prostitute. I am providing Let me handle this. Dennis is providing a very important service to lonely people in need. Really? So he speaks for you now? No. I was He doesn't have to speak if he doesn't want to. I don't? Really? No. You leave everything to me. All you have to do is sit there, relax, have yourself a drink and just keep looking handsome. Okay. I like that arrangement. Get me a beer, Frank. Oh, no beer. Too many calories. Yep. It's all about keeping this body fit. Mm-hmm. Ehheh. I'll get you a nice vodka tonic. Well, that doesn't have much calories so I think that's a smart drink. I take care of my boy. Every time you talk, you weaken the nation. Shut up. Why you wanna hurt me? I'm not hurtin' you. Just shut up and play cards. You're judgin'. You judge me all the time. I'm just tryin' to remain elegant over here. Don't try so hard. Remain quiet. Oh! Youse guys got the right idea with these. It's, like, the perfect mix of comfort and wind resistance. They make that In men's? Huh? I think this is men's. Yeah, it's men's. Listen, guys. I was thinkin' we go down to Paddy's, put the squeeze on 'em. We're right in the middle of somethin' right now. Don't you guys do anything besides play cards and eat deli meats? Go wash my car. Fellas! I feel like I'm being seriously underutilized here. Look, if you just give me a chance I could show you how hard I actually am. What? That's right. I'm so hard that people are scared of me. And they should be, 'cause I'll explode all over them. What's the matter with you? I'm eatin' here. What? What are you talkin' about, your dick? My dick? No, I'm talkin' about my brute force and my catlike reflexes. You hear that, Anthony? He's got catlike reflexes. That's right. Hands like a cat. You know what? I think someone just earned themselves a nickname. Really? What? Yep. From now on, you'll be known as Pussy Hands. I'd like to go on record saying I don't like Pussy Hands. But Cougar Hands would be good. Here's to you, Pussy Hands. That's great. It's settled. Hey, Pussy Hands, go wash my car. How about Jaguar Hands? Nah. Leopard Hands? Nah. Panther Hands. Nah. Goddamn it. Go get your saucer of milk, honey. He does have gorgeous hands though. Excuse us. Excuse me. Sir? Ma'am? Hi. Would you two be interested in These people are just walking too fast. You know what we should do? We should go back to the country club. Remember the country club, with the jockeys? This about the horse, Charlie? It is about the horse. Goddamn it. I'm pretty sure those jockeys are raping that horse. They're raping the shit out of it. Excuse me, sir. Can I talk They're racing by us as fast as they can. These people are revved up. They're in fifth gear, and we're stuck in first. We need to boost our r.p.m.'s. Let's get goin' a little bit. What are you suggesting? A little dip into our Bolivian marching powder, then we're back on the street. Not in your nose. That's how you become a drug addict. Rub it all over your gums, Dee. All over your gums. Okay. Feel that? How's that feel for you? Whoa. I see what you mean, Charlie. I see It's like my mouth is no longer a part of my head. I kind of feel nothing, but it feels so good. That's the feeling you're going for. That's where you wanna be at. Keep reapplying every 10 to 15 minutes. That's what I've been doing. It kinda wears down. What? Charlie. Ten to 15 minutes? No. We're gonna run out. No more gumming for a little while. No more gumming. We're good though. I'm ready. I'm good. I feel pretty good. I feel weird, but pretty good. Let's start the show. Let's be like Wall Street and Rickety Cricket. That's Rickety Cricket! Rickety! Rickety Cricket! Rickety! Rickety Cricket! Rickety! Where have you been hiding? Where have you been? They let you become a priest again, huh? Congratulations. It's the reverend. Hey, man. How you doin', man? Keep your head up, Reverend. Keep the faith. Bless you. Oh. Yikes. I get it. It's like Okay. Ever since you convinced me to abandon the church my life has been in a bit of a tailspin. Who? Me or Charlie? You, Dee. You. That doesn't ring a bell. There was something that happened. I wasn't sure that it was that. I don't think it was that. So you're livin' on the streets now, Cricket. Yes, I'm living That's great. That's really great. Actually, it's the opposite of great, Charlie. It's one of the darkest times of my life. Is it? Is it? That makes sense. Yes. But the good thing is that you must know a lot of drug addicts. Yes. I was actually attacked by a couple last night. Almost got stabbed. Really? That's great. Did you? Did you really? Wonderful, Cricket. Then you can help us sell our cocaine. Do you know those guys? Can you sell drugs to them? Do you bump into them? Do you guys hang out on certain corners? Are you close? Whoa, whoa, whoa. You want me to sell drugs for you? We would do it, but we're not street urchins. Yeah, man. Yeah. Know what I mean? But you. They would buy drugs from a street urchin like yourself. You got the "street urchin" thing goin' on. Please stop calling me a street urchin. I'm not a street urchin. You are what you are now. You know what I'm sayin'. I was a priest. I have a master's in theology. That was then. This is now. What good's it doing you? I am trying to get my life back on track. I don't think selling drugs is a smart move. Uhoh. I'm sorry. Come on, Cricket. I guess Charlie and I didn't see you sitting atop your homeless ivory tower. Oh, oh, oh, oh. What is your problem? You just push my buttons, don't you? You just enjoy pushing my buttons. What have you done? I've done nothing to her. Can I stop this little lovers' quarrel? You're not fooling anybody, Cricket. Clearly, the two of you have strong feelings for each other and you're letting that get in the way of a good business deal here. Look, Cricket, for the love of God, help us out here, man. I am not I tell you what. I'll let you stay at Dee's place. No. Till you're back up on your feet. Dee's place? Yeah. You two alone, together. One thing could lead to another. You never know. You think she still likes me? Yeah. I wasn't sure. I know we have sort of a sexual tension. No, no, no. You guys got your own thing going on. I gotta take a cut now, Cricket. We're working together. Jesus Christ, Frank. I can't believe you had that thing made. Every pimp has a chalice. This one is the shit. Great. How much money did you drop on that? A lot. You spend a shitload of money on a chalice you're just gonna eat cereal out of but you won't bail us out by paying the mob? By the way, your Jane is sitting over there. Aw, you gotta be kid Dude, she's, like, a hundred years old. Sixty-eight tops. That's still extremely old. Well, I'm not kissing that. You don't have to kiss her. We can make that one of your rules. This time, nothing with the ass. That got really weird last time. What are you talkin' about? You didn't set up that ass play on the last one? No. I never set up any ass play. All right. Well. I wanna set up a doctor's appointment anyway just to be just to be safe. All right. Do that. All right. Here we go. Hypothetically speaking here do you think you could teach a horse to sit on a barstool and drink beer? I don't know. Maybe. Would you hypothetically pay really good money to see that? Is this about bringing a horse back to the bar? That is completely insane. I'm askin' hypothetical questions here. I'm sorry. I'm a little preoccupied with worrying about being killed by the mob because a homeless priest ran off with all of our drugs. Sure. Sure. Who is it? It's Matt. Who? Matthew Mara. It's Rickety Cricket. It's Rickety Cricket. It's Rickety Cricket. Hey! Come on in, man. Hey! Come in. Oh! Yeah! Where should I put this? Why does he have that? Why does he have his stuff? Charlie said I could move It's not important. Look at this place. It's exactly as I imagined it would be. What is? Cricks? How'd you do with our drugs, man? Oh. Uh, I sold 'em. Here. Hey, is there a dream catcher above your bed? Shit, shit, shit! Holy shit! Look at all that money. That is a huge wad of money. This is more money than we make at the bar. I have never seen this much money in one spot. Oh, my God. I guess we can pay the mob back. We can definitely pay them back. That's good. But we have another day. We have a whole day. We have 24 whole hours to go. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. He flipped this in what? No time really. He flipped it so fast, Charlie. Let's think a little bit for a second. We could flip another batch. We could pay the mob back. We could have money left over for ourselves. Maybe a little coke. Yeah, more coke. I can get a horse. You're not gonna get a horse, Charlie. We can have some coke then. She likes Swiss! I knew it! I pictured Swiss. Hey, uh, Cricket. Cricket, buddy. Can I talk to you for a second? Look, uh, you did such a fantastic job that we're gonna need you to go back out there and do it again. But you guys said it was a onetime thing. We say things all day. We say words all the time. We said so many things. I was thinking maybe I'd curl up on that bed of Dee's and I'd sleep with the bear. Now's not a good time for that, man. I'm so tired. Are you tired? I'm just so tired. Check it out. I got the thing for you right here. Where'd you get that? Every good dealer keeps a head stash. No. Dip your finger in there. Look, Cricket. I got the thing for you here. I can't. Let's speed you up. And then you'll wanna get back out there. Oh. Aah. Yeah. Oh. Shh. Where am I having dinner tonight, Frank? I'm kind of in the mood for Asian fusion. No more dinners. We're going straight to bangin' from now on. Check this out. Jesus Christ, man. What, you got a problem? Yeah. This makes me seem like a whore. You are a whore. I'm not a whore. I'm a handsome companion who goes to nice dinners with fancy women and who has rules about what he'll do. What happened to the rules, Frank? You can still have your rules. It says right here "No Rules. " Don't be so uptight. I'm walkin' from this What the hell, dude? I'm knocking some sense into you, Dennis. This is all you got. Dude, why do you keep hitting me? Don't talk back to me! Okay. Sorry. Look, I'm gonna get you out of this. It's you and me against the world. I'm not gonna let anything bad happen to you. You promise? I promise. And, hey, I don't wanna hit you, baby. So please don't make me, okay? You're my one and only. You gotta do right by me, okay? Okay. Come on, Cricket. Where is he, Charlie? Why do we trust him? He came through for us once. He'll do it again. This is empty. Get rid of that. You know what, this is his whole plan. It's not a plan. Yeah. He convinced us that he was on our side. Now he's gonna stab us in the back. I don't think so. What's with the pants? These things? These are horse-riding pants. You can't get a horse. Why not? Because it's crazy. Is it any crazier than having a dog that bites or sheds? Or a cat that poops in a box while it's biting you? While it's biting you? Oh! You guys! Cricket! There you are! What are you doing? Cricket! There you are! I'm workin' on my moves. What moves? For my musical. I'm writing a musical. It's about life on the streets. Archangel has to live on the streets and fight crime. What? That's great. Where are our drugs? I sold the drugs. Good. Give us the money. Spent the money on these sweetass kettledrums. Look at these. Those are trash cans. Trash cans, Cricket! These are trash cans? Then why do they sound like this? You "sold" our drug money on two garbage cans? No. No, no, no, no. I did some too. We can see that! Is there any left? Can we have what's left? There is some left. You guys are yelling like crazy. I can't compute. Don't do all of it. I still gotta write the seventh act. It's kinda all up here. Come on back to the bar. Let's go. I'm not going anywhere without these kettledrums. Bring your trash cans. Yeah, don't forget the trash cans. I'm bringing the trash cans. Watch the crack addicts though. They will cut you. You understand? It's $200 for the first hour and a hundred and fifty every hour after that. Unless you want him to act like he's enjoying it. Then it's a little extra. Eh? All right. I need I need you Make it sexy. I need I need you You like ass play? He'll do anything with the ass. I never said I wasn't gonna tell Don Sal? Yeah. What? Forgive me for speaking out of line here, but I don't think I'm being properly utilized within the organization. I've tried to be eager and work with a smile but I'm not making any forward progress. Aren't you the janitor? It's not important, Don Sal. What is important is that I get out on those streets and start doing some gangster shit. There's gotta be a union boss I can put the squeeze on. Or a truck I can hijack, right? How would you like to do me a personal favor? Sounds shady. I'm in. Good. I need you to go over to my house and take care of my wife. You mean, like, rub her out? No. Oh. You want me to bang her? I'm sorry. No! What the hell is wrong with you? Why would you say that? Communication problem. What I need you to do is just go over there. Like a protection thing. Yeah. It's somethin' like that. Okay. I mean, you don't mind gettin' your hands dirty, do you? Absolutely not. Good. Goddamn mafia! Two hearts that beat as one Like that? Huh? Get what you want? Just keep dancing, whore. Two hearts that beat as one Dennis? We gotta talk. Now. What the hell you doin' here? I'm working. What are you doing? You cannot seriously be thinking about banging this old lady. No, Mac, you have to separate yourself from the way they look. Frank says that the only thing that matters in this game is cash. What did Frank do to you? Frank takes care of me. You don't understand the nature of our relationship. What? Hey! Hey! You! Out! This is our turf. Get out. Frank, he cannot bang this woman. It's the mob boss's wife. What do you think she's gonna do call her husband and say she's banging a whore? Dennis, up those stairs. Dennis, don't do it. He's got you brainwashed. Go! Dennis! Stay!
